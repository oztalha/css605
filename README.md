##css605
This project keeps my assignment submissions for the class of
**CSS	605 -	Object-Oriented	Modeling	in	Social	Science** offered in Fall 2014
at *George Mason University*

### Motivation
Provide	the	students	with	the	computing	skills	needed	to	perform	research	in	CSS.		The	course	
will	cover	object-oriented	design	and	implementation	with	a	focus	on	developing	agent-based	
models.		Java	is	the	programming	language	used	this	semester	and	the	code	development	will	be	
demonstrated	in	Eclipse.
